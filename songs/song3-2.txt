I won't just survive
Oh, you will see me _1_
Can't write my story
I'm beyond the _2_
I won't just conform
No matter how you shake my core
'Cause my roots they run deep, oh

Oh, ye of so little _3_
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Victory is in my _4_
I know it, I know it
And I will not _5_
I'll fight it, I'll fight it
I will transform

When, when the fire's at my feet again
And the _6_ all start circling
They're whispering, "You're out of time"
But still I rise

This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in
Think again
Don't be surprised
I will still rise
I must stay _7_
Through the madness and _8_
So I call on my angels
They say

Oh, ye of so little _3_
Don't doubt it, don’t doubt it
Victory is in your _4_
You know it, you know it
And you will not _5_
Just fight it, just fight it
And be transformed

'Cause when, when the fire's at my feet again
And the _6_ all start circling
They're whispering, "You're out of time"
But still I rise

This is no mistake, no accident
When you think the final nail is in
Think again
Don't be surprised
I will still rise

Don't doubt it, don't doubt it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You know it, you know it
Still rise
Just fight it, just fight it
Don’t be surprised
I will still rise
