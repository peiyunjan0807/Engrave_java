_1_ at the sky
_2_ at the world
Baby, why'd you go away?
I'm still your girl
Holding on too _3_
Head up in the clouds
_4_ only knows
Where you are now
How do I love
How do I love again?
How do I trust
How do I trust again?
I stay up all night
Tell _5_ I'm alright
Baby, you're just _6_ to see than most
I put the _7_ on
Wait 'til I hear our song
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost

Never got the _8_
To say a last goodbye
I gotta move on
But it hurts to try
How do I love
How do I love again?
How do I trust
How do I trust again?
I stay up all night
Tell _5_ I'm alright
Baby, you're just _6_ to see than most
I put the _7_ on
Wait 'til I hear our song
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
How do I love
How do I love again?
How do I trust
How do I trust again?
I stay up all night
Tell _5_ I'm alright
Baby, you're just _6_ to see than most
I put the _7_ on
Wait 'til I hear our song
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
