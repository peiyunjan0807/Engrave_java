When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me
When you come around me
Do me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me
Diggin' the way you feel on my skin
Got _1_ on me, can't _2_
Oh no, next thing you're on top of me
Okay with this I call that a _3_

So, when you come around me
Treat me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me
When you come around me
Do me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me
Let's not miss out on each other
Let's get it in _4_
All that I want for you is _5_
Put me down _6_

Who taught you how to drive stick?
You a fool _7_ it
Love the way you fool _7_ it
And the way you motion
Motion in my lap
Love the way you move with it

So, when you come around me
Treat me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me
When you come around me
Do me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me
Let's not miss out on each other
Let's get it in _4_
All that I want for you is _5_
Put me down _6_

When I rise up
Baby don't shy up
Open your mind
Don't knock it 'til you try it, darling
Show off
When you come closer
Don't waste no time
I love it when I'm in it, _8_

When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me
So, when you come around me
Do me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me
When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me
So, when you come around me
Do me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me
