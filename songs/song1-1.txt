Didn't wanna be a ghost
But you _1_ me over and over
Never thought I'd have a vice
Other than you, over and over
Left you in the sky with the fire _2_
Thought I had it right, but I'm still
Lost in the light
And I don't know what night it is
You're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to _3_
Blurry bodies, but you're on my mind
We let it go now I'm full of rum and _4_
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out, go out

I never thought a _5_
Could burn more than a midnight without you
Already paying for tonight
Head spins like a _6_, over and over
Left you in the sky with the fire below
Thought I had it right, but I'm still
Lost in the light
And I don't know what night it is
You're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to _3_
Blurry bodies, but you're on my mind
We let it go now I'm full of rum and _4_
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out, go out

Two more _7_ on the wood floor, but it ain't you
I'm _8_ so I bring someone home
Over and over, I do this and I'm still
Lost in the light
And I don't know what night it is
You're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to _3_
Blurry bodies, but you're on my mind
We let it go now I'm full of rum and _4_
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out just so I can reforget
I go out, go out
