Mmm
Hey, yeah
(That's just for fun)
(What?)
I'm not one to _1_ around
One _2_ and you're out, baby
Don't care if I sound crazy
But you never let me down, no, no
That's why when the sun's up, I'm stayin'
Still layin' in your bed, singin'
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Got all this time on my hands
Might as well _3_ our plans, yeah
I could stay here for a lifetime

So lock the door
And _4_ out the key
Can't fight this no more
It's just you and me
And there's nothing I, nothing I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you

So go ahead and drive me _5_
Baby, run your mouth
I still wouldn't change being stuck with you
Stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you, baby

There's nowhere we need to be
No, no, no
I'ma get to know you better
Kinda hope we're here forever
There's nobody on these _6_
If you told me that the world's ending
Ain't no other way that I could _7_ it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Got all this time in my hands
Might as well _3_ our plans (yeah)
I could stay here forever

So lock the door
And _4_ out the key
Can't fight this no more
It's just you and me
And there's nothing I, nothing I, I can do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So go ahead and drive me _5_
Baby, run your mouth
I still wouldn't change being stuck with you
Stuck with you, stuck with you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you

Whoa, whoa, oh
Baby, come take all my time
Go on, make me lose my mind
We got all that we need here _8_
I lock the door (lock the door)
And _4_ out the key
Can't fight this no more (can't fight this no more)
It's just you and me
And there's nothing I, nothing I'd rather do
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
So go ahead and drive me _5_
Baby, run your mouth
I still wouldn't change
All this lovin' you, hatin' you, wantin' you
I'm stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with
You
Stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you
