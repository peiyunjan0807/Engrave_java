I found myself dreaming
In _1_ and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight
And you pulled me close
Split second and you _2_
And then I was all alone
I woke up in tears
With you by my side
A breath of _3_
And I realized
No, we're not _7_ tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for _4_
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

In the _5_ of an eye
Just a _6_ of smoke
You could lose everything
The _8_ is you never know
So I'll kiss you longer, baby (hey)
Any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes
And love with no regrets
Let's take our time to say what we want (say what we want)
Use what we got before it's all gone (all gone
'Cause no (no), we're not _7_ tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you (lose you)
I'm gonna hold you (hey) like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing (yeah)
I won't take you for _4_
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love (I'm gonna love you) 
you like I'm gonna lose you (like I'm gonna lose you)
I'm gonna love you (love you) 
like I'm gonna lose you

I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you (oh, like I'm gonna lose you)
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for _4_
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love (I'm gonna love you) you like I'm gonna lose you (like I'm gonna lose you)
I'm gonna love you (love you) like I'm gonna lose you
