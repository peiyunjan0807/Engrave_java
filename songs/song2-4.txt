There's no reason, there's no _1_
I found myself _2_ by
A feeling that I've never known
I'm dealing with it on my own
Phone is quiet, walls are _3_
I drink myself to sleep, who cares?
No one even has to know
I'm _4_ with it on my own

I got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody help, it's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light _5_, everything is dark
Way too much _6_ in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time?

Every thought's when it gets late
Put me in a _7_ state
I wish I wasn't going home
Dealing with it on my own
I'm praying but it's not enough
I'm done, I don't believe in love
Learning how to let it go
_4_ with it on my own

What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light _5_, everything is dark
Way too much _6_ in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time? Yeah

I drive circles under street lights
Nothing seems to clear my mind
I can't forget
It's inside my head, so
I drive, _8_ Malibu nights
Nothing seems to heal my mind
I can't forget

Hey, hey, na-na
