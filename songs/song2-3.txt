I am not a stranger to the dark
Hide away, they say
'Cause we don't want your broken parts
I've learned to be _1_ of all my scars
Run away, they say
No one'll love you as you are
But I won't let them break me down to _2_
I know that there's a place for us
For we are _3_

When the _4_ words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown 'em out
I am brave, I am _5_
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no _6_, this is me
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh

Another round of _7_ hits my skin
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in
We are bursting through the _8_ and
Reaching for the sun (we are warriors)
Yeah, that's what we've become (yeah, that's what we've become)
I won't let them break me down to _2_
I know that there's a place for us
For we are _3_

When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown 'em out
I am brave, I am _5_
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no _6_, this is me
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
This is me

And I know that I deserve your love
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) There's nothing I'm not worthy of
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown 'em out
This is brave, this is _5_
This is who I'm meant to be, this is me

Look out 'cause here I come (look out 'cause here I come)
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum (marching on, marching, marching on)
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no _6_, this is me
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown 'em out
I'm gonna send a flood
Gonna drown 'em out
Oh
This is me
